🔐 **Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst**  
💞️ Looking to collaborate on secure and innovative software or IT projects  

## 👀 **What I'm Into**:
* Information Technology - love exploring how systems work together
* Cybersecurity (Threat Prevention, Network Security fundamentals) - honestly, it's fascinating stuff
* Software & Web Development - especially when security is built in from the start
* Firebase-based apps - they're perfect for rapid prototyping
* Tech for Social Impact - using code to actually help people

## 💻 **My Programming Languages**
* **Python**: My absolute favorite for backend work
* **Java**: Perfect for building solid, reliable object-oriented applications  
* **JavaScript**: Makes websites come alive with interactivity
* **HTML/CSS**: The bread and butter of web development - gotta love clean, structured pages
* **SQL**: Super useful for diving into databases and getting the data you need

## 🧱 **Frameworks, Libraries & Platforms**
* **React.js** *(still learning, but loving it)*: Makes building user interfaces so much cleaner
* **Firebase**: Amazing for real-time databases, user authentication, and quick hosting
* **Provider (Flutter)**: Keeps state management organized in mobile apps
* **Flutter/Dart**: Great for building apps that work everywhere - iOS, Android, web

## 🛡️ **My Cybersecurity Learning Journey**
* Introduction to Cybersecurity principles - building that solid foundation
* Threat prevention & detection basics - it's like digital detective work
* Network security fundamentals - understanding how to keep connections safe
* Secure coding practices - because security should be baked in, not bolted on
* Exploring beginner CTF challenges - they're way more addictive than I expected!

## ⚙️ **Tools & Development Setup**

## ⚡ **Fun Fact**
**Here's what I've realized**: Cybersecurity isn't just about stopping the bad guys (though that's important too!). It's really about **protecting real people and the systems they depend on every day**. Every secure app I help build could be safeguarding someone's personal photos, financial data, or important communications. That responsibility is both exciting and motivating - I'm genuinely pumped to help make the digital world a safer place, one line of secure code at a time! 🔒💻✨
